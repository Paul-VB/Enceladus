GAME SUMMARY: ENCELADUS SUBMERSIBLE EXCAVATOR
=============================================

I. CORE CONCEPT & SETTING
--------------------------
Genre: 2D Submersible Action/Mining/Survival
Setting: The lawless, deep subsurface ocean of Saturn's moon Enceladus.
Theme: Morally gray resource exploitation and combat against rival mining companies.
Physics: Low gravity and near-neutral buoyancy create a unique "floaty flying" movement.

II. THE SUBMERSIBLE & CONTROLS
-----------------------------
The submersible is a heavy-duty mining rig whose systems are centered on two core modes:

1.  COARSE MODE (Traversal)
    - Purpose: High-speed movement, dodging, and fleeing in open water.
    - Movement: WASD translates the sub. Sub auto-levels for max thrust.
    - Combat: Uses 360-degree Aft Weapons (LMB) for defense while moving.

2.  FINE MODE (Precision)
    - Purpose: Drilling, careful navigation, and targeted combat.
    - Movement: WASD slews the sub slowly while holding a fixed attitude.
    - Combat: Rotates the sub with the mouse to aim the fixed-arc Mining Lasers (RMB).

Mode Switch: Instantly toggled with a single key press (e.g., SHIFT).

III. PROGRESSION & CUSTOMIZATION
--------------------------------
Equipment (Weapons, Power Cores, Melt-Beam) is governed by two systems:
- Mark System: Defines base power and efficiency (Mark 1, 2, 3...).
- Quality System: Defines the number of Augment Slots (Common, Rare, etc.).

Augment Extraction: Allows a player to destroy an item to salvage its augment and apply it to a preferred item.

Key Augments:
- Weapons: Rage Rounds (turn enemies against each other), Plasma Lense (Damage over Time), Cryo-Projector (slows targets).
- Power Cores: Nanite Repair, Phase Shift (Dodge chance), Heat Sink Array (slows tunnel refreeze rate).

IV. ENVIRONMENT & HAZARDS
-------------------------
- Iceologic Instability: Drilling too much in one sector causes temporary instability (tunnel collapse risk), forcing the player to move to a new area and return later.
- Tunnel Refreeze: Mined tunnels slowly freeze over, creating time pressure for deep dives and escape.
- Biomes & Loot: Different sectors feature unique hostile life and high-value loot:
    - Minerals: Rare elements embedded in the ice (extracted by the Melt-Beam).
    - Organics (Goo): Specialized compounds harvested from unique alien life forms (e.g., Catalyst Gel from swarms, Carapace Resins from predators).

V. ECONOMY & META-GAME
---------------------
- Hostile Rivals: Competing mining subs attack to steal loot. Destroyed rivals yield scrap, unique upgrades, and their haul.
- The Base: Always accessible for selling haul, repairs, and refueling (energy is required for drilling/thrusters).
- Orbital Trader: A high-value vendor who is only accessible at the base for a few minutes each "day." Sells rare, high-tier weapons and core augments, adding a layer of time pressure.
